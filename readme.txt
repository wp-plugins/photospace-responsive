A simplified version of Photospace featuring a responsive only layout.

== Description ==

Based on the Galleriffic gallery, Photospace takes advantage of the built in gallery features of WordPress.
Then simply use the WordPress admin to create a gallery and insert it in the page. You may need to adjust the size of the gallery to suit your theme in the settings.

The Photospace gallery plugin allows you to:

* Upload multiple images at once
* Easily order images via drag and drop
* Add a title, caption and description

Via the options panel you can modify:

* Thumbnail number, size and shape
* Size of the main image
* The width of the main images

Some other features include:

* Keyboard control
* Pagination
* Supports multiple galleries (Displayed via multiple posts)

1. Upload `/photospace-responsive/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Upload some photos to the post or page where you want the gallery
